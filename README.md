# Headphone-App-UI
A Palette object gives you access to the primary colors in an image, as well as the corresponding colors for overlaid text.The palette library is a support library that extracts prominent colors from images to create visually engaging apps.

In this project, I have designed the app to purchase head phones where the background color of the layout will be selected from the head phone image view using Palette API in android.
